HN Comment Collapser
====================

I wanted collapsible comments for hacker news.  This terrible bit of JavaScript makes that happen.

Installation
------------

1. `cd` into where ever you want to put this plugin
2. `git clone git://github.com/chrisguitarguy/HN-Collapsible-Comments.git`
3. In Chrome, open the main menu > tools > extensions
4. Click on "Developer mode" in the top right corner
5. Click on "Load an upacked extension..." and navigate your newly created folder, select it, hit open
